- Principal protection through diversified vault strategies
- Integration with leading DeFi protocols (Teahouse, Gamma, Reserve)
- Support for major assets (USDC, WETH) across multiple vaults
- Real-time monitoring of vault performance and NAV
- Flexible positions as lender or borrower
- Transparent terms and risk assessment tools

### Supported Networks
- Arbitrum

## Common Tasks

   - "Supply 1 WETH to Teahouse WETH vault as a borrower on Arbitrum"
   - "Deposit 1000 USDC to Gamma USDC vault as a lender on Arbitrum"
   - "Add 0.5 WETH to Reserve WETH V3 vault as a borrower on Arbitrum"

2. Withdrawals
   - "Withdraw 200 USDC from my Teahouse USDC vault lender position on Arbitrum"
   - "Remove 0.3 WETH from Steadefi WETH vault borrower position on Arbitrum"
   - "Withdraw all my USDC from Gamma USDC vault lender position on Arbitrum"

3. Information Queries

## Why Protocol Debt?
Protocol debt represents the future standard of DeFi lending by addressing two crucial barriers in the yield-farming space:
- **Yield Uncertainty**: Fixed-rate returns provide predictability
- **Risk Complexity**: Principal protection and simplified risk assessment

By encapsulating yield-bearing liquidity pools with protection mechanisms, Copra makes DeFi lending more accessible and secure for both protocols and users.
